Processing sketchbook - experiments and code examples
=====================================================


Each of the examples here is a self-contained processing sketch (so far).
Most of them do not require any additional libraries and should run on any p5 installation (only tested with 2.x, though)

Mostly, these are my own experiments with graphics and animation and not really meant to be too educational, but if they can be helpful or interesting, here they are.

A list of sketches inside:

this is an attempt to figure out the P3D graphics mode and how to deal with 3d primitives.
